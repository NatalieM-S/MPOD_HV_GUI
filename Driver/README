This driver is intended for a Wiener MPOD Crate running HV power supplies. 
It has been partially tested on the following modules: 
- EHS 84 60n
- EHS 84 40p
- EHS 84 20n

This (Work in Progress) driver is meant to provide access to functionalities not available in stock programs or GUIs. 

Resources used to develop this driver package: 
- SNMP documentation
- Iseg SNMP Programmers Guide
- Wiener MPOD HV&LV Power Supply System Technical Manual
- FSU's guide at https://fsunuc.physics.fsu.edu/wiki/index.php/Python_Iseg_HV_controller 

MIB files are available at https://file.wiener-d.com/software/net-snmp/ 

Setup instructions: 
(Linux)
1) Install snmp: 
    Required:
        sudo apt-get install snmp 
    Maybe optional:
        sudo apt-get install snmp-mibs-downloader
        sudo sed -i 's/mibs :/# mibs :/g' /etc/snmp/snmp.conf 
2) Download MIB file (link above) WIENER-CRATE-MIB.txt into /usr/share/snmp/mibs (Windows: C:\usr\share\snmp\mibs)

Most functionality comes from MPODClass.py, which is plotted by GUI.py
Currently exception handling is quite minimial and statuses are not read out or handled.
Some examples are given, but the main files to be tested are GUI.py, backup1.py and backup2.py
They can be run as complete files, or the backup files could be run line by line in a terminal. 
Make sure requirements.txt is installed.
